# Network Stat

Welcome to Network Stat Project 

### What is network-stat? 
Network stat is a collection of scripts which collects different internet quality parameters from user systems. It can be used by organizations to monitor the quality of service for their users. After collecting this data, it can be analyzed to understand how the network is performing from client’s perspective. We can probably answer questions like these:
 - Is everyone getting good wifi strength? 
 - How is the signal strength affecting the latency.
 - Which wifi band is performing better? 
 - How does network quality vary across campus. 
 - Has any access point malfunctioned? 
 - Should the access point be replaced? 
 - Client’s wifi drivers are outdated or wifi device is malfunctioned.
and more.

It is a project under development and is not ready to use. 


 
### What we want network-stat to do? 
  - Collect network quality parameters from the client system.
 
### What we want to do with the data collected? 
Analyze the collected data to: 
  - Identify malfunctioned/misconfigured access points in the network. 
  - Identify hosts with poor Internet connectivity 
  - Idnetify hosts having problems with wifi drivers or wifi adapter.
  - Identify hosts 

This repository only deals with the data collection part. There's a different repository for analyzing the collected data which will be put up soon.
